# Features
**Navigation** - When greeted with the homepage you will be welcomed with a huge header-image with a user friendly 
navigation bar just under with the pages **Home, Gallery and Contact**. All these link to other pages on the site.

The navigation bar is really easy to see as the colors I have picked is a constant black, orange and white 
throughout the whole webpage. 

# The Header
The theme for the header I have chosen an image of a dog purely for the cutenest and it will attract more
attention to the user. When creating the site I have chosen the color orange for the theme because of the 
color of the dog, easy to the eye. 

Within the header I have styled a box that has the company name with a little slogan indicating that
the Paws Animal Clinic have 10 years of experience and they business. 

Just beneath the header I have just added a small picture with the location of the company to make it easier for the 
user to find and navigate. **(This also includes the company number & email address)**.

# Testing

I tested this page and it all works in browsers such as : Chrome, Opera, Firefox.

I have confirmed that this page works on all platforms (devices) and have checked
through the scaling through the inspect element. 

I have used flex style to scale for devices from side-by-side > columns. 
Scaling from 1200 to 950px.
## Before Scale

When testing the CSS validator I had 3 errors when entering the wrong values, I simply removed these from the
style.css and then the bugs were fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When testing the HTML validator there were so many errors, turns out to be the font awesome ending tags duplicating
when I was copy and pasting from the website when putting in the icons. I simply fixed this by removing them.
The second issue I encountered was a huge mistake by me as I didn't put the heading or footer within the body element. 
I found this issue out when on humble with my mentor.

# Validator Testing

**HTML** No errors found when using the offical W3C validator

**CSS** No errors found when using the offical Jigsaw validator

**Accessibility** I confirm that the colors and the fonts are easy to read but the only known error 
I have is apparently my foreground has an issue but Orange and Black is easy to read and looks fine 
to me and everyone I have shown?

# Credits 

Footer was inspired from the Love Running project that was in the previous assignments, 

Most of the styles that really helped me and often used within this project was 
https://www.w3schools.com - this really helped and. With me being new to this it was a 
matter of messing with the inspect element and see what was what etc. 

# Images

Photos I have used are mainly my dogs and my friends but the header was taken from google
images.
